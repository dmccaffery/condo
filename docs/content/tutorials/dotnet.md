# Build and publish a project with .NET CLI

First refer to docs for [getting started with condo][get-started].

Once you have the four necessary files (`condo.build`, `condo.cmd`, `condo.ps1`, `condo.sh`) you are ready to set up
your project to utilize condo.

This tuturial will cover the default implementation of condo (default implementation lifecycle docs found
[here][lifecycle]).

For reference, condo's default lifecycle is as follows:

1. Clean
2. Initialize
3. Version
4. Prepare
5. Compile
6. Test
7. Package
8. Build

Dotnet project specifications are found in the `Prepare`, `Compile`, `Test`, `Package`, and `Publish`, and `Document`
target tasks.

## Prepare

In the `Prepare` target task, condo will prepare:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

```bash
dotnet build
```

```bash
dotnet pack
```

```bash
dotnet test
```

```bash
dotnet publish
```

```bash
dotnet push
```

Condo will also prepare a lot of metadata.

## Compile

In the `Compile` target task, condo will prepare dotnet build properties and add them to MSBuild.

## Test

In the `Test` target task, condo will

## Package

In the `Package` target task, condo will

## Other target tasks with Dotnet specifications

### Publish

In the `Publish` target task, condo will

### Document

In the `Document` target task, condo will

To publish a project with the .NET CLI, developers will need to have code under a `/src` folder and tests under a
`tests` folder.

Tests will be run with XUnit. Condo will look for tests with a specified `[Purpose]` and `PurposeType`.
Supported PurposeTypes include:

* Unit
* Integration
* EndToEnd
* Performance

For E2E tests, a `CollectionDefinition` with `E2ECollection` must be specified.
